### https://pawsiblefoods.com/
I designed and developed a bespoke website for Pawsible Foods, a trailblazer in the pet food industry. Harnessing the power of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I tailored a paws-itively unique digital kennel that makes Pawsible Foods the alpha in the online pack. The website's bark is as strong as its bite, thanks to a custom authentication system, ensuring a secure and tail-wagging experience for every user. I also buried a bone with a bespoke Content Management System (CMS), perfect for managing a litter of articles, giving the site a dynamic and playful edge. A major treat in my development process was fetching top-notch SEO strategies, ensuring that Pawsible Foods doesn't just sit and stay but also races ahead in search engine results.

### https://montage2023.github.io/
For Montage 2023 website development, I sought to blend artistry with advanced web technology, crafting a site that offers a rich, dynamic user experience. I drew the background in layered sections to create a parallax effect; as the user moves their mouse, each layer shifts counter to the cursor's movement, encapsulating the theme "Stillness is Another Action" in an interactive form. Furthermore, to meet my client's desire for a distinctive font reminiscent of 'The Great Gatsby,' I designed a bespoke typeface from scratch, ensuring their vision for elegance and classic style was fully realized. Precision in animation is another hallmark of this siteâ€”details and movements are fine-tuned to an extent that may go unnoticed to the untrained eye, but stand as a testament to my commitment to perfection.

### https://www.sinolioncapital.net/
Creating the website for Sinolion Capital was a journey of innovation and detailed craftsmanship. My goal was to encapsulate the essence of their brand through a seamless digital experience. I handcrafted a distinctive logo that resonates with their corporate identity, using a color palette that reflects their values and vigor. On the technical front, I leveraged unique and creative elements to ensure the website stands out. The card hover effect is a highlight, giving users the sensation of a levitating card that responds to mouse movement, creating a captivating parallax effect. I paid meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that even the smallest elements, like the navigation bar and FAQ dialogues, are animated for an engaging, interactive experience.

Responsiveness was paramount. I meticulously coded the website to be responsive across an exhaustive range of devices, including ultrawide monitors, desktops, mobiles, tablets, folding phones, and even square screens, ensuring a flawless display and functionality on every possible screen size.

## AI's I've developed:

### Stable Diffusion Model with ability to run on low VRAM GPUs
I developed a groundbreaking Stable Diffusion Model optimized for low VRAM GPUs, a pioneering solution for high-quality image generation on more accessible hardware. My development, crafted through intensive training on Azure VMs with an investment of $16,000 AWS Credits over four months, is tailored to perform exceptionally on laptops with just 4GB of VRAM. This model stands apart in its ability to produce images comparable to those generated by models requiring 16GB of RAM. A significant breakthrough is the model's precision in rendering hands, a common challenge in AI-generated imagery, ensuring flawlessly detailed and realistic hand representations. Additionally, I have enriched the model with a diverse artistic flair, incorporating over additional 500 million anime-style images sourced from platforms like Pixiv and Danbooru. This unique blend of technological sophistication and artistic diversity positions my model as a distinct and superior choice in the realm of AI-generated art and some of it was automated and posted on instagram at @incineroarblast.
